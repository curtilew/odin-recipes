    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        A doner kebab is a popular Middle Eastern and Mediterranean dish consisting of 
        seasoned meat that's stacked in the shape of an inverted cone and slowly roasted on a vertical rotisserie.
        The meat—typically lamb, beef, chicken, or a mixture—is shaved off in thin slices as it cooks. These slices 
        are then served in a variety of ways:

        Wrapped in a flatbread such as pita or lavash
        Served on a plate with accompaniments
        Stuffed into a sandwich roll
    </p>

        A traditional doner kebab is usually garnished with fresh vegetables like tomatoes, onions, and lettuce, and 
        topped with sauces such as garlic yogurt, tahini, or a spicy chili sauce. Some variations might include pickled 
        vegetables, hummus, or french fries.
        The dish originated in Turkey (where "döner" means "rotating") but has become immensely popular worldwide, with 
        regional variations like the Greek gyro, Arabic shawarma, and German-Turkish döner kebab sandwich, which is served 
        in bread with a variety of sauces.
        The combination of juicy, flavorful meat, fresh vegetables, and creamy sauces makes it a satisfying street food enjoyed 
        around the world.
