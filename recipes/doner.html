    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        A doner kebab is a popular Middle Eastern and Mediterranean dish consisting of 
        seasoned meat that's stacked in the shape of an inverted cone and slowly roasted on a vertical rotisserie.
        The meat—typically lamb, beef, chicken, or a mixture—is shaved off in thin slices as it cooks. These slices 
        are then served in a variety of ways:
    </p>
    <p>
        Wrapped in a flatbread such as pita or lavash
        Served on a plate with accompaniments
        Stuffed into a sandwich roll
    </p>
    <p>
        A traditional doner kebab is usually garnished with fresh vegetables like tomatoes, onions, and lettuce, and 
        topped with sauces such as garlic yogurt, tahini, or a spicy chili sauce. Some variations might include pickled 
        vegetables, hummus, or french fries.
        The dish originated in Turkey (where "döner" means "rotating") but has become immensely popular worldwide, with 
        regional variations like the Greek gyro, Arabic shawarma, and German-Turkish döner kebab sandwich, which is served 
        in bread with a variety of sauces.
        The combination of juicy, flavorful meat, fresh vegetables, and creamy sauces makes it a satisfying street food enjoyed 
        around the world.

    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <p><strong>Prepare the meat mixture:</strong></p>

            <li>If using whole meat cuts, 
                slice them very thinly or grind them.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, combine the meat with 
                grated onion, minced garlic, spices 
                (cumin, coriander, paprika, oregano, black pepper, 
                cayenne, salt), tomato paste, lemon juice, and
                 olive oil.</li>
            <li>Mix thoroughly, then cover and refrigerate for at 
                least 2 hours (overnight is better) to marinate.</li>
            
            
            <p><strong>Shape the meat:</strong></p>

            <p>(For a homemade version, you have two options)</p>
            
            <li>Pack the meat mixture firmly into a loaf 
                shape on a baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Form it around a vertical skewer if you 
                have the appropriate equipment.</li>
            
            <p><strong>Cook the meat:</strong></p>
            
            <p><em>Oven method</em></p>
            <li>Bake the meat loaf at 350°F (175°C) for about 
                45-60 minutes until cooked through.</li>

            <li>Let the meat rest for 10 minutes before slicing.</li>
            
            <p><strong>Slice the meat:</strong></p>
            
            <li>Using a sharp knife, slice the meat as thinly as 
                possible.</li>
            <p><em>For extra authenticity, you can briefly sear the 
                slices in a hot pan.</em></p>
            
            
            <p><strong>Prepare the sauces:</strong></p>
            
            <p><em>Garlic yogurt sauce</em></p> 

            <li>Mix Greek yogurt with minced 
                garlic, lemon juice, and salt.</li>

            <p><em>Tahini sauce</em></p> 

            <li>Blend tahini paste with lemon juice, garlic, water, 
                and salt until smooth.</li>

            <p><em>Chili sauce</em></p> 

            <li>Blend or finely chop chilies with vinegar, garlic, 
                and salt.</li>
            
            
            <p>Warm the bread:</p>
            
            <li>Heat pita bread or other flatbreads in a dry pan or 
                oven until warm and slightly puffed.</li>
            
            
            <p><strong>Assemble the kebab:</strong></p>
            
            <li>Spread sauce on the bread.</li>
            <li>Add a generous portion of sliced meat.</li>
            <li>Top with shredded lettuce, sliced tomatoes, 
                onions, and cucumbers.</li>
            <li>Add additional sauce and any other desired 
                toppings.</li>
            <li>For a wrap-style kebab, fold or roll the bread 
                to enclose the fillings.</li>
            
            <p><strong>Serve immediately:</strong></p>
            
            <p>Enjoy while hot, with extra sauce on the side if 
                desired.</p>
