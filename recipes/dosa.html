    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        A dosa is a thin, crisp pancake or crepe originating from South India, made from a fermented batter of rice and 
        black gram (urad dal). When properly prepared, dosas have a golden-brown exterior that's crispy and lacy around 
        the edges, while remaining slightly soft and chewy toward the center. They're typically served folded in half or 
        rolled into a cylindrical shape.</p>
    <p>
        Chutney is the perfect accompaniment to dosa, providing a burst of flavor that complements the mild tanginess of 
        the fermented dosa. The most common chutneys served with dosa include:</p>
    <p>
        1. Coconut chutney: A smooth, cooling blend of freshly grated coconut, green chilies, ginger, and tempered with mustard 
        seeds, curry leaves, and dried red chilies in hot oil.</p>
    <p>
        2. Tomato chutney: A tangy, slightly sweet preparation made with sautéed tomatoes, onions, and spices.</p>

    <p>
        3. Mint-coriander chutney: A vibrant green, herbaceous sauce with a refreshing kick from fresh mint and cilantro leaves, 
        green chilies, and a hint of lemon juice.</p>
    <p>
        The combination creates a perfect balance of flavors and textures—the crispy, slightly tangy dosa paired with the cool, 
        spicy, or tangy chutney makes for a satisfying meal that's enjoyed for breakfast, lunch, or dinner throughout India and beyond.
