    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        A dosa is a thin, crisp pancake or crepe originating from South India, made from a fermented batter of rice and 
        black gram (urad dal). When properly prepared, dosas have a golden-brown exterior that's crispy and lacy around 
        the edges, while remaining slightly soft and chewy toward the center. They're typically served folded in half or 
        rolled into a cylindrical shape.</p>
    <p>
        Chutney is the perfect accompaniment to dosa, providing a burst of flavor that complements the mild tanginess of 
        the fermented dosa. The most common chutneys served with dosa include:</p>
    <p>
        1. Coconut chutney: A smooth, cooling blend of freshly grated coconut, green chilies, ginger, and tempered with mustard 
        seeds, curry leaves, and dried red chilies in hot oil.</p>
    <p>
        2. Tomato chutney: A tangy, slightly sweet preparation made with sautéed tomatoes, onions, and spices.</p>

    <p>
        3. Mint-coriander chutney: A vibrant green, herbaceous sauce with a refreshing kick from fresh mint and cilantro leaves, 
        green chilies, and a hint of lemon juice.</p>
    <p>
        The combination creates a perfect balance of flavors and textures—the crispy, slightly tangy dosa paired with the cool, 
        spicy, or tangy chutney makes for a satisfying meal that's enjoyed for breakfast, lunch, or dinner throughout India and beyond.

    <h3>Steps</h3>   
        <ol>
            <p><strong>Dosa Batter</strong></p>

            <li>Rinse rice and urad dal separately, about 3-4 times until water runs clear</li>
            <li>Soak rice, urad dal, and fenugreek seeds in separate bowls of water for 4-6 hours</li>
            <li>Drain the water from all ingredients</li>
            <li>Grind urad dal and fenugreek seeds together with a little water until smooth and fluffy</li>
            <li>Grind rice with water until smooth but slightly grainy</li>
            <li>Mix both batters together in a large container</li>
            <li>Add salt and mix well</li>
            <li>Cover and let ferment in a warm place for 8-12 hours (overnight)</li>
            <li>The batter should rise and become slightly bubbly when properly fermented</li>

            <p><strong>Cooking Dosa</strong></p>

            <li>Stir the fermented batter gently (add water if needed to get pouring consistency)</li>
            <li>Heat a flat non-stick or cast iron pan/griddle</li>
            <li>Test if the pan is hot enough by sprinkling a few drops of water - they should sizzle immediately</li>
            <li>Lightly grease the pan with oil</li>
            <li>Pour a ladleful of batter in the center of the pan</li>
            <li>Using the back of the ladle, quickly spread the batter in a circular motion to form a thin pancake</li>
            <li>Drizzle a little oil around the edges and on top</li>
            <li>Cook on medium heat until the edges start to lift and the bottom turns golden brown</li>
            <li>For crispy dosa, cook only on one side; for softer dosa, flip and cook briefly on the other side</li>
            
            <p><strong>Tomato Chutney</strong></p>

            <li>Heat oil in a pan, add onions and garlic, and sauté until translucent</li>
            <li>Add tomatoes and cook until soft and mushy</li>
            <li>Add red chilies, tamarind paste, salt, and a pinch of jaggery</li>
            <li>Cook until the mixture thickens</li>
            <li>Let it cool and then grind to a smooth paste</li>
            
            <p><strong>Tempering</strong></p> 
            
            <li>heat oil, add mustard seeds, urad dal, and curry leaves</li>
            <li>Pour this tempering over the tomato chutney and mix well</li>
        </ol>
