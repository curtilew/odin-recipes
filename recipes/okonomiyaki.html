    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Okonomiyaki is a beloved Japanese dish that resembles a savory pancake, with its name literally 
            meaning "grilled as you like it." The foundation consists of a batter made from flour, eggs, and 
            dashi stock, generously mixed with shredded cabbage and various ingredients such as thinly sliced 
            pork belly, seafood, or vegetables according to personal preference or regional style. Once cooked 
            on a hot griddle until golden and crispy on the outside while remaining tender inside, it's topped 
            with a sweet-savory okonomiyaki sauce, Japanese mayonnaise, dried seaweed flakes (aonori), and bonito 
            flakes (katsuobushi) that gently "dance" from the rising heat.</p>

        <p>
            Two distinct regional styles dominate the okonomiyaki landscape: the Kansai/Osaka style, where all 
            ingredients are mixed together before cooking, and the Hiroshima style, characterized by its layered approach 
            with a thin base layer of batter, a mountain of cabbage, protein, and often yakisoba noodles. In Japan, 
            okonomiyaki is frequently enjoyed at specialized restaurants featuring built-in table grills where diners cook 
            their own pancakes, transforming a simple meal into an interactive social experience that embodies the customizable 
            spirit of this comfort food classic.
